Java 3D Animation Cube

The Java 3D Animation Cube project is a graphical application that demonstrates a rotating 3D cube using Java Swing. It utilizes matrix transformations for rotation and projection, and implements a Z-buffer algorithm for hidden surface removal.

Features

3D Cube Rotation: Demonstrates smooth rotation of a 3D cube on user interaction.

Z-buffer Algorithm: Implements depth testing to handle visibility of surfaces.

Wireframe Mode: Toggle between solid and wireframe rendering modes.

Technologies Used

Java Swing: For creating the graphical user interface.

Matrix Operations: Utilizes matrix multiplication for 3D transformations.

Z-buffering: Algorithm used for hidden surface removal.
